# Contract
This is the repo of our smart contract

## token standard
ERC1155

## dependence
OpenZeppelin

## coding platform
1 https://remix.ethereum.org/
2 create contract file under contracts dir
3 compile 
4 deploy contract in a blockchain net
5 after the test, we can publish on Ipfs

## what we need to connect the contract
After we deploy our contract we can search our contract in https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/(virtual) or etherscan.

We need ABI(functions that are supported by our contract) and our contract address for future use.
